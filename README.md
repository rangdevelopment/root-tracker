3. You may add the event type like "Dray roots" or "Dray sap"
3. Additional people can confirm with "Dray c" or "Dray conf"
4. When the event ends type "Dray d" or "Dray dead" and the timer will end
5. If an event is fake, type "Dray fake"
6. If someone kills an event early, you can revive it by typing "Dray not dead" or "Dray alive"
